# Claude Tools ClickUp Task Manager

This repository demonstrates how to use Anthropic's Claude AI model with custom tools to manage tasks in ClickUp. The project showcases the integration of Claude's powerful language capabilities with practical task management functionalities.

## Features

- Interact with Claude to manage ClickUp tasks
- Demo OKRs for Michael Scott from The Office (for testing and demonstration purposes)
- Utilizes Pydantic for data validation and serialization
- Implements a flexible tool system for extending functionalities

## Key Components

### Pydantic Models

The project extensively uses Pydantic for data validation and serialization. This ensures type safety and provides clear structures for input and output data.

### Function I/O Map

The `function_io_map` is a central component that defines the available tools, their input/output types, and descriptions. Here's an example of how it's structured:

```python
function_io_map = {
    "add_tags_to_task_core": {
        "input": TaskTags,
        "output": TaskUpdateModel,
        "description": "Adds specified tags to a task",
        "function": add_tags_to_task_core
    },
    "update_task_core": {
        "input": TaskUpdate,
        "output": TaskUpdateModel,
        "description": "Updates a task with the provided information",
        "function": update_task_core
    },
    # ... other functions ...
}
```

## Adding New Tools

To add a new tool to the system:

1. Create Pydantic models for the input and output of your new tool.
2. Implement the tool function.
3. Update the `function_io_map` with the new tool information.

Example:

```python
# Step 1: Create Pydantic models
class NewToolInput(BaseModel):
    param1: str
    param2: int

class NewToolOutput(BaseModel):
    result: str

# Step 2: Implement the tool function
def new_tool_function(input_data: NewToolInput) -> NewToolOutput:
    # Implementation here
    pass

# Step 3: Update function_io_map
function_io_map["new_tool_name"] = {
    "input": NewToolInput,
    "output": NewToolOutput,
    "description": "Description of what the new tool does",
    "function": new_tool_function
}
```

## Michael Scott's OKRs

The project includes a set of demo Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) for Michael Scott from The Office. These are used for testing and demonstration purposes, showcasing how the system can handle real-world-like goal setting and task management scenarios.
